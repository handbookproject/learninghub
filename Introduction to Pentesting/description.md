What's penetration testing? Well it's simple, as security professionals our job is to make it extremely difficult to get inside our systems. Remember, you can't stop attackers, your job is to slow them down. How? Let's start by doing exactly what the attacker will do. Penetration testing (pen testing) is the practice of attacking your own network or that of a client's, using the same tools, techniques, and steps that an attacker would. The purpose of pen testing is to expose gaps, weaknesses, and possible entry points without doing any real damage. In this course, you will learn how to prepare, execute a pen test, and how you should report your results in a way that will add value to your time and efforts.
