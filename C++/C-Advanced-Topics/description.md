Once you know the basic of C++ syntax and what the Standard Library offers you, it’s time to establish whether you’re writing good code or not. Modern C++ is expressive, readable, fast, and secure. In most cases the faster thing to do is also the easier thing to do and the safer thing to do – no tradeoffs! In this course you’ll draw on your C++ Fundamentals knowledge to explore a number of ways to ensure your applications are implemented in Modern C++, not C-With-Classes or other old-style idioms. You’ll take advantage of the Standard Library and write code that is future proof and safe.
