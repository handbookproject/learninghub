C++ is a general purpose programming language that is used by millions of developers. It offers a powerful combination of performance and abstraction that other languages don’t have. You can use C++ to write different kinds of applications for a variety of platforms. In this course, I’ll cover basics of language syntax – declaring variables, classes, building expressions using operators and functions – and work up to templates, pointers, const, and polymorphism. I’ll be using the principles of “modern C++” as much as possible, relying on the Standard Library and using idioms like Resource Acquisition is Initialization to reduce the effort involved in memory management. Some people are scared of C++, but I’ll show you how to approach the language without fear.
