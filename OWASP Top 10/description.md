Security on the web is becoming an increasingly important topic for organisations to grasp. Recent years have seen the emergence of the hacktivist movement, the increasing sophistication of online career criminals and now the very real threat posed by nation states compromising personal and corporate security. The Open Web Application Security Project gives us the OWASP Top 10 to help guide the secure development of online applications and defend against these threats. This course takes you through a very well-structured, evidence-based prioritisation of risks and most importantly, how organisations building software for the web can protect against them.
