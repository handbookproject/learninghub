This is what it all comes down to. After we've done our research, we've found our target, and identified its services, shares, users and resources, itâ€™s time to take total and complete control of this box. In turn, we then use this box to repeat our efforts to pwn more boxes within the network as well as grab any intellectual property that could be of great worth. This course is part of the Ethical Hacking Series. http://blog.pluralsight.com/learning-path-ethical-hacking
