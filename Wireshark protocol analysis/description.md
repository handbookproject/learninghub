Wireshark is a very powerful tool for troubleshooting, but getting started with it can be overwhelming when it comes to the protocols for solving network behavior issues. This course, Troubleshooting with Wireshark: Fundamental Protocol Analysis, will help you to understand how fundamental protocols operate using Wireshark as the mechanism for observing protocol logic in action. You'll start by learning about Ping and Traceroute and how they make use of ICMP, an important troubleshooting protocol, and ICMP messages. Next, you'll cover DHCP traffic, options, and improper behavior, followed by learning about basic DNS operation and DNS issues. Finally, you'll learn about TCP operations, sequence and acknowledgment numbers, and behavior. By the end of this course, you'll be able to expertly use Wireshark to analyze and solve complex network protocol issues you may have in the future.
