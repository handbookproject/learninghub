Buffer overflow is a topic that only software developers using low-level programming languages really get an opportunity to fully understand. However, IT security professionals are increasingly called upon to better understand how vulnerabilities created by poor software design and implementation practices can be exploited to create security issues in systems and networks. The problem is that most IT professionals do not have the extensive software development background needed to tackle the subject of buffer overflow. This course breaks down the technical subjects of computer memory management, controlling code, and data inside of a running program, and exploiting poor quality software into terms that IT people with no software development experience can understand. Also examined are ways to prevent buffer overflow conditions and minimize the impact of buffer overflows that do happen. This course is part of the Ethical Hacking Series. http://blog.pluralsight.com/learning-path-ethical-hacking
