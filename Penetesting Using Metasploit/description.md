Metasploit is one of the most widely used tools for penetration testing, providing powerful attack simulations, security assessment management, and more. In this course, Introduction to Penetration Testing Using Metasploit, you'll learn to use Metasploit to enumerate available services, identify potential weaknesses, test vulnerabilities through exploitation, and gather evidence for reporting. First, you'll see how to install and configure the Metasploit Framework and several supporting tools on Kali Linux. Next, you'll explore how exploits and payloads work together to gain access to systems. Finally, you'll look at how Metasploit Framework releases are made available and how to maintain the latest version of the Framework. By the end of this course, you'll have a better understanding of how to use Metasploit to quickly assess the security posture of systems and networks to reduce risk.
