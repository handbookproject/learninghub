Mastering the command line is so important when it comes to managing the Linux Server. Very often there will be no GUI and all access is via SSH from PuTTY or another client. You will soon learn the speed at which tasks can be achieved from the CLI and why it is so powerful. You may be used to the up arrow key for your Windows history, but the Linux history is so much more. Searching and reading from files is quick and easy, and many tools will be covered giving you the skills you need to manage your servers and desktops.
