This course will help you see how much you can enjoy system administration, and how there is a life outside of your current role. Linux is prevalent, it is at the heart of "the cloud" and is hosting companies both big and small. In a recent survey, 93-percent of employers suggested that they plan to hire a Linux professional. This course is designed to get you up and running with Linux starting with the install, and passing through to basic management such as installing software and managing the file system. Being able to see these tasks completed in different Linux flavors will help you understand which Linux distribution is best for you, and prepare you for the vendor neutral certification for the LPI (Linux Professional Institute). This is an administration course, so basic concepts of system administration are expected, but prior knowledge of Linux or Unix systems is not required. We at Pluralsight would like you to again understand the enjoyment that system administration once gave you.
