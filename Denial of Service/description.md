Denial of service attacks typically seek to render a service unavailable by flooding it with malicious traffic so that it becomes unresponsive to legitimate requests. In this course, Ethical Hacking: Denial of Service (part of the Ethical Hacking series), you'll look at the purposes of these attacks, ranging from disrupting gaming adversaries, to hacktivism, and to law enforcement by government agencies. You'll also explore various ways attacks are constructed and the weaknesses they exploit in order to be successful. Finally, you'll delve into defensive patterns to help protect services from malicious attacks. By the end of this course, you'll have a much better understanding of denial of service attacks and how to protect yourself from them.
